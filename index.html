    <h2> About</h2>
        My previous experience mainly lies within the realm of higher education/student affairs and nonprofit work. While I loved being student-facing in my work, I was always curious about how I could apply myself in the webpage developing space. <br /> <br/>
        After some time in the education sphere and obtaining my Masters degree, I realized that I was in dire need of an actual break due to burnout. After this break, I saw that there were bootcamp programs that would allow me to pivot into this new industry. <br /> <br />
        I am enrolled in <a href ="https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive?&topic=&mkt_account_id=1056949875&mkt_campaign_id=1741487179&mkt_ad_group_id=68632981419&mkt_device_type=c&mkt_keyword=software%20engineering%20general%20assembly&mkt_matchtype=e&mkt_placement=&mkt_ad_id=549295011563&mkt_network=g&mkt_target_id=kwd-865210826802&mkt_feed_item_id=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid-search-bra&utm_campaign=TS:TX:BRA:SFX:BRTP:COD:SoftwareEngineering:GeneralAssembly&utm_content=PDP-FT&utm_term=software%20engineering%20general%20assembly&gclid=CjwKCAjwh4ObBhAzEiwAHzZYU-wIbHXIAaFZ3M4AhCzO8eLI0OaJraGYL44z1-eMu3mcV8mZ79nDdBoCeRYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Remote </a> program, which will give me the technical skills to become a software engineer in the near future!
